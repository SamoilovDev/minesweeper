# minesweeper
This is a minesweeper text game.

Initially, you set two parameters,
this is the size of the field and the number of mines on the field.
Each of the parameters is asked by the program and is given by one number.

Each turn you give two numbers and a word.
The first number is the selection of the field by the X coordinate. 
The second number is the selection of the field by the Y coordinate.
The word can be either "free" or "mine".
If you select the word "free", then the program opens this field and all the free fields nearby, if you do not hit a mine.
If you chose "mine", then the program puts a flag in the form of "*" at the given coordinates.
Everything is like in the game minesweeper! :)

Mark all mines, without erroneous marks or open all free fields - you win.
"Stepped" on a mine - you lost.
Have a nice game!
